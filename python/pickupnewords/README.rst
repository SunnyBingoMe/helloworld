A little program that find out the words new to you from a text file.

Scenarios
=========

| Before enjoying your movie, you can run this program to find out the new
| words from the movie's subtitle files. Then you maybe look up all of them.
| So that they(new words) won't interrupt your movie time ;-)
|
| Also, picking up the new words from other **plain texts** is encouraged.

------------------------

HOWTO
=====

Find out the new words
----------------------

Put **pickupnewords.py** and **oldwords.dat** under same directory. Run::

  python pickupnewords.py /path/to/your/moviedir/Serendipity.en.srt

Remember the words
------------------

| The initial words database(*oldwords.dat*) is very basic and we will find
| that many words are known at the beginning several times running the
| program. A clever program should remember them, which no doubt.
|
| Fortunately, our program support this ;-) You can enter a few patterns of
| directives in the prompt to tell the program to remember the words.
|
| The above command will always output a list of the new words like:

::

   0. chore            1. skeleton         2. vile             3. sloth                                           
   4. segregate        5. costume          6. mob              7. keychord                                        
   8. senseless        9. sacrilege       10. bravery         11. morgue                                          
  12. immature        13. limbo           14. knob            15. jerk                                            
  16. egotistic       17. fluid
  Stroe the words already known(? for help)> **ENTER DIRECTIVES HERE**

| Now you can tell the program which words should store. We have following
| patterns of commands:

- Remember the exact words by entering the index number::

    0,9,13,21

- Remember all of the words except::

    !0,9,13,21

- Remember all::

    all

- Remember nothing(either of them)::

    !
    !all
    JUST HIT ENTER

- Remove some words from oldwords.dat::

    -word1, word2, word3

In the future, feel free to pick up the real new words.
